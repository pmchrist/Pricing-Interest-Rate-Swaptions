Main objectives:
    Model Interest Rates (Start with Hull-White model, to consider LIBOR, Real World data calibration, something else?)
    Price in the Swaption (Start with Longstaff Schwarz Model(LSM) routine)
    Add Greeks and Surface
    ???

    Questions:
        What is the difference and usecase between Short (is it the same as instantaneous?) and Forward rate models?
        Where can we get data for calibration?
        What are some interesting examples from real world of Bermuda Option Payoff?
        How to validate result? Only parts?
        Shouldn't the Bermuda option with more often available exercise be more expensive?
